py -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
copy .env.example .env
python app.py
```

Open: http://127.0.0.1:5000

## Demo accounts

- Admin: `admin@agc.local` / `Admin@123`
- Organizer: `organizer@agc.local` / `Organizer@123`
- Student: `student@agc.local` / `Student@123`

The app creates the database and demo data automatically on first run.

## Email verification / password reset

For local college demo use, SMTP is optional. When SMTP variables are blank, the verification/reset URL is printed in the Flask terminal.

For real email, fill the SMTP values in `.env`.

## GitHub

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial Campus Event Management System"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/campus-event-management-agc.git
git push -u origin main
```

Do not commit `.env` or `instance/cems.db`.

## Important

This project intentionally uses a **demo payment flow**. It does not collect real card/UPI credentials. For a production deployment, connect an approved payment provider and move secrets to environment variables.

## AGC Institutional Customization
The landing page and seed data are customized for Amritsar Group of Colleges (AGC) using the institutional information supplied for this academic project. It includes AGC branding language, autonomous status, NAAC A Grade, AICTE/PCI references, IKGPTU affiliation, IQAC/ISO/NPTEL/AISHE references, campus modules, contact-directory sections, and AGC-focused sample events.

> Note: institutional statistics and notices shown in the demo are based on the supplied project/reference content and should be re-verified against the college's current official material before production use.
